Can we create an ecosystem that could make it radically easier for thousands of grassroots organizations to produce creative DataViz? And in the process  help progressive artists & graphic designers from marginalized communities?  That's what this [Data Chefs](https://datachefs.org) pilot project will begin to explore.
- [Overview](pages/overview.html) of our assumptions and approach 
- [Criteria](pages/pilot-criteria.html) for creative DataViz pilot examples
- Notes dump about what we will expect from and how we will work with [volunteers](pages/volunteers.html)
- [Notes](pages/old-notes.html) from previous pilot projects, including examples of what  [DataViz code](pages/code-examples.html) might look like and quick-and-dirty [explorations](pages/old-dataviz-examples.html) of creative DataViz
