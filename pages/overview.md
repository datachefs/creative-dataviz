### The Vision 

Back before everything was digital, many organizers routinely used pictures or objects like pennies, toys, etc. to turn data into stories. Now that most data is electronic, itâ€™s much less common.  And these days, truly creative data visualizations are often expensive to create and difficult to reuse.

But the past few years have opened up some interesting opportunities:
- New free tech -- e.g., open source JavaScript libraries such as [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [BablyonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/) -- that can produce amazing graphics and animation
- New global networks of liberal and progressive artists and graphic designers who are fired up about working with the community. 

As a result, we believe we are at the point where we could foster a diverse, community-oriented  ecosystem that could:
- Make it radically easier for grassroots organizations to produce creative DataViz that could be used in community organizing, political organizing, union organizing & bargaining, and fundraising
- Potentially support progressive artists & graphic designers, especially those from marginalized communities, by creating a stream of paid work from large nonprofits as well as other opportunities 

### Core Assumptions
- __Operating at Scale__. Our goal is to make it possible for hundreds or thousands of grassroots groups to be able to easily build creative DataViz. So from the start we'll explore what it will take to scale up.
- __Simple Coding over Point-And-Click__.  Many DataViz tools are like microwaving Hot Pockets: you can create great bar charts or dashboards, but you're limited to what the tool was designed to do.  Our goal is to create a set of resources that are more like baking cupcakes: you don't have to be a pro to get great results, but you have much more flexibility in what you can make and you can easily develop your skills over time.  To do so, we will create lightweight libraries on top of existing JavaScript frameworks to make it easy to get started and easy to level up 
- __Adventurous Beginners__. This pilot project is focused on empowering "adventurous beginners" -- grassroots staff or members who are reasonably fluent with Excel or Google Sheets and who may not know anything about coding but are excited about the opportunity to learn a bit

### The Pilot

In an ideal world, we would test out this idea by working closely with 2-3 grassroots organizations, some of which had chapters in several states. But as initial conversations have demonstrated, even groups who are fired up about the idea of creative dataviz at scale simply don't have the focus/bandwidth right now.  And given how critical the 2024 elections are, realistically they won't have the room to do so until early 2025.

So, we are going to use a less than ideal approach to ensure that when these groups are able to focus, we've made some headway and have some concrete examples to spark their imagination. Here's how the pilot will work:

1) Recruit a small design team of volunteers who are experienced graphic designers, artists, and JavaScript developers, some of whom have experience working with/on large-scale grassroots campaigns

2) Based on our understanding of typical organizing needs and some brief conversations with grassroots groups, iteratively develop a few concepts of creative DataVizes, ideally that could be used by multiple chapters or states, and explore a few JavaScript graphic libraries to see what might best fit our needs

3) Develop a proof of concept consisting of examples that can be used to 
  - Help grassroots groups understand what's possible and give them something concrete to react to
  - Give us a better feel for what's easy and hard to do

In creating these examples, we will also develop draft versions of:
- A v0.1 lightweight JavaScript library
- Quick and dirty draft training materials / cheat sheets
- Sample creative assets that could be used to easily create variations of these examples -- e.g., for a Halloween version of a monthly state-by-state report

4) Reflect, Iterate
- Reflect on what we've learned 
- Figure out which grassroots groups and/or networks of grassroots groups we'll collaborate with to test out what we've built so far
- Consider how newly emerging AI tech -- chatgpt, [Hex Magic](https://hex.tech/magic, etc -- might influence where the project is headed
