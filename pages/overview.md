Back before everything was digital, many organizers routinely drew pictures or used objects like pennies to turn data into stories. Now that most data is electronic, it’s much less common. And when people do it, it tends to be expensive and a one-off.

But in the past few years, two changes have opened up some interesting opportunities:
- New free tech -- e.g., open source JavaScript libraries such as p5.js and BablyonJS -- that can produce amazing graphics, and based on our experience in the field, we believe these libraries could be modified so that an adventurous beginner could easily use them
- New global networks of liberal and progressive artists and graphic designers who are fired up about working with the community. 

As a result, we believe we are at the point where we could foster a diverse community/ecosystem that could:
- Make it radically easier for grassroots organizations to produce creative DataViz that could be used for community & union organizing, union bargaining – especially Bargaining for the Common Good -- and fundraising
- Create opportunities for progressive artists & graphic designers -- especially those from marginalized communities --  to partially support themselves with a steady stream of paid work from large nonprofits as well as eventually from corporations and governments

### Pilot Goals and Process


 

### Examples

Here's a page with a few examples I’ve played around with. As will be obvious, I am a terrible graphic designer; these were just quick and dirty proof of concepts about what it would take. To get a better sense of what in general JavaScript libraries can do these days, here are some example of simple animation from a class I taught at the American Speech Language and Hearing Association (ASHA) in d3js, an earlier JavaScript library that would we wouldn’t use now – it’s too damn hard – but gives you a sense of what’s possible.
