### The Vision 

Back before everything was digital, many organizers routinely drew pictures or used objects like pennies, toys, etc. to turn data into stories. Now that most data is electronic, itâ€™s much less common. And when people do attempt to make creative data visualizations, it tends to be expensive and a one-off.

But in the past few years, two changes have opened up some interesting opportunities:
- New free tech -- e.g., open source JavaScript libraries such as [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [BablyonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/) -- that can produce amazing graphics and animation
- New global networks of liberal and progressive artists and graphic designers who are fired up about working with the community. 

As a result, we believe we are at the point where we could foster a diverse ecosystem that could:
- Make it radically easier for grassroots organizations to produce creative DataViz that could be used in community organizing, union organizing & bargaining, and fundraising
- Help support progressive artists & graphic designers, especially those from marginalized communities, by creating a stream of paid work from large nonprofits as well as other opportunities 

### Assumptions
- __Operating at Scale__. Our goal is to make it possible for hundreds or thousands of grassroots groups to be able to easily build creative DataViz. So from the start we need to  take at least some  baby steps towards exploring what it might take to scale up.
- __Adventurous Beginners__. This pilot project is focused on empowering people we call "adventurous beginners":  staff or members who are at least reasonably fluent at using Excel or Google Sheets to muck around with data and who while they may not know anything about coding are excited about the chance to play and learn.
- __Coding over Point-And-Click__
  - Many DataViz tools are like microwaving Hot Pockets: you can create great bar charts or even dashboards, but you are limited to what the tool was designed to do. 
  - Our goal: create a set of resources that are more like baking cookies or cupcakes: you don't have to be a professional to get great results, you have a lot more flexibility, and it's far easier to develop your skills over time.  
  - To make this work, we will create lightweight libraries on top of existing JavaScript libraries to make it substantially less intimidating to get started while still leaving plenty of room to spread your wings over time.

### The Pilot

This project is pretty ambitious. How do we even begin?  By running a pilot project to get our feet wet, test some of our assumptions, and start learning from experience what's easy and hard to do.

Here's how the pilot will work:

- Select 2-3 grassroots-oriented nonprofits who are interested in experimenting and who are willing to set realistic expectations. At least 2 of these grassroots groups should have multiple chapters, ideally in several states, so they provide an opportunity to explore what it would take to build creative DataViz at scale.
- Work with each of these grassroots groups to iteratively develop 1 or 2 concepts for a creative DataViz, ideally one that can be used by multiple chapters/organizations
- Drawing on networks of graphic designers and developers, recruit 2 teams of volunteers:
  - A team to work with the pilot groups
  - A team to play with several JavaScript graphic libraries and create a set of examples that can be used both to help grassroots groups understand what's possible and to get a better feel of what's easy and hard to do
- After several months, reflect on what we've learned and figure out next steps
