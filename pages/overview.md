### The Vision 

Back before everything was digital, many organizers routinely drew pictures or used objects like pennies, toys, etc. to turn data into stories. Now that most data is electronic, itâ€™s much less common. And when people do attempt to make creative data visualizations, it tends to be expensive and a one-off.

But in the past few years, two changes have opened up some interesting opportunities:
- New free tech -- e.g., open source JavaScript libraries such as [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [BablyonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/) -- that can produce amazing graphics and animation
- New global networks of liberal and progressive artists and graphic designers who are fired up about working with the community. 

As a result, we believe we are at the point where we could foster a diverse, community-oriented  ecosystem that could:
- Make it radically easier for grassroots organizations to produce creative DataViz that could be used in community organizing, union organizing & bargaining, and fundraising
- Try to support progressive artists & graphic designers, especially those from marginalized communities, by creating a stream of paid work from large nonprofits as well as other opportunities 

### Assumptions
- __Operating at Scale__. Our goal is to make it possible for hundreds or thousands of grassroots groups to be able to easily build creative DataViz. So from the start we need to  take at least some  baby steps towards exploring what it might take to scale up.
- __Adventurous Beginners__. This pilot project is focused on empowering people we call "adventurous beginners":  staff or members who are at least reasonably fluent at using Excel or Google Sheets to muck around with data and who while they may not know anything about coding are excited about the chance to play and learn.
- __Simple Coding over Point-And-Click__
  - Many DataViz tools are like microwaving Hot Pockets: you can create great bar charts or even dashboards, but you are limited to what the tool was designed to do. 
  - Our goal: create a set of resources that are more like baking cookies or cupcakes: you don't have to be a professional to get great results, you have a lot more flexibility, and it's far easier to develop your skills over time.  
  - To do so, we will create lightweight libraries on top of existing JavaScript libraries to make it substantially less intimidating to get started while still leaving plenty of room to spread your wings over time.

### The Pilot

This project is pretty ambitious. How do we even begin?  By running a pilot project to get our feet wet, test some of our assumptions, and start learning from experience what's easy and hard to do.

In an ideal world, we would work closely with 2-3 grassroots nonprofits, at least 2 of which had multiple chapters in the several states, to iteratively build some experiments. But initial conversations have shown that even folks at these groups who are fired up about the idea simply don't have the focus/bandwidth right now (in early 2023). Given how critical the 2024 elections are, realistically they won't have the room to focus until early 2025.

So, we are going to use a less than ideal approach to make sure that in 20 months, when these groups are able to focus, we've made some headway and have something to show them. Here's how the pilot will work:

1) Recruit a design team consisting of experienced graphic designers, artists, and JavaScript developers, some of whom have experience working with/on large-scale grassroots campaigns

2) Iteratively develop a few concepts of creative DataVizes, ideally that could be used by multiple chapters/states, and explore JavaScript graphic libraries to map out our options

3) Develop a proof of concept consisting of examples that can be used to 
  - Help grassroots groups understand what's possible and give them something to react to
  - Help us get a better feel of what's easy and hard to do

In creating these examples, we will also develop draft versions of:
- A v0.5 lightweight JavaScript library
- Quick and dirty draft training materials / cheat sheets
- Sample creative assets that could be used to easily create variations of these examples -- e.g., for a Halloween version of a monthly state-by-state report

4) Reflect on what we've learned and figure out next steps
