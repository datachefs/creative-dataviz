When we're deciding which creative Dataviz we want to build during the pilot project, here are some of the main criteria we'll use:

- __Shiny__: is it fun and/or playful?
- __Easily Tweakable Code__: could the code be easily modified by an "adventurous beginner" -- somebody who's good with Excel or Google Sheets, and is willing to mess around a bit if they have a simple example to work from
- __Reusable, Scalable__: eg, could several locals or chapters easily repurpose the DataViz for their own needs?
- __Clear Goal__: why would this creative DatViz be useful?  What purpose would it serve?
