For the pilot project to succeed, we need to pick examples that push things enough so we learn from them but are manageable enough so odds are we will succeed. Here's what we'll need:

What We Are Looking for:
- __Shiny__: is it fun and/or playful?
- __Easily Tweakable Code__: could the code be easily modified by an "adventurous beginner" -- somebody who's good with Excel or Google Sheets, who's willing to mess around a bit if they have a simple example to work from
- __Reusable, Scalable__: for example, could several locals or chapters easily repurpose the DataViz for their own needs?
- __Low Stakes__: our goal isn't to produce a perfect DataViz, it's to use it as an opportunity to explore what makes for great, scalable creative DataViz. So, for example, you wouldn't want to pick a creative DataViz that you're planning on highlighting at your national conference

Lower Priority Goals for Now:
- __Goal-Oriented__: In the long run, with every creative DataViz we want to ensure that we are clear about our goal and how the DataViz will try to achieve it. But right now, we are just getting our feet wet. Trying to figure out what makes for a good creative DataViz and what works best for your audience and nailing a goal is way too much pressure.
- __UX Usability__: If we dramatically reduce the friction involved in creating a new creative DataViz, will be much easier to end up with DataViz that really grab people's attention, engage them in thinking and wrestling with trade-offs (where appropriate), etc. So if it doesn't pass a good usability checklist right now, that's okay
