  The following are a handful of quick and dirty experiments I've done over the years. As you will see, I'm definitely not a graphic designer.  Scrounging around to find them was also a reminder of why it's a good idea to use version control religiously; I couldn't find a number of old interesting examples, and some of them relied on links to my older repos that no longer exist.

## p5.js

[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) is a web-based JavaScript version of [Processing](https://processing.org/), "a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts."

## BabylonJS

BabylonJS is a powerful JavaScript library for creating WebVR. It can be a bit intimidating to get started if you don't have any programming background. So, I experimented with creating a library that hides some of the trickier stuff.

- Simple 3D visualization using data: [Goals](http://makersall.org/playful-coding/pages/bjs-viz/goals/index.html).  You can rotate the view using your mouse
- Animation:  [Moore's Law](http://makersall.org/playful-coding/pages/bjs-viz/moores-law/index.html). Because we're trying to capture the impact of exponential growth, it takes a bit for the animation to noticeably grow￼￼





## D3.js

At ASHA, my team and I experimented D3.js.  For example: 
- Sample data viz for a course, [A Taste of D3](http://aschneiderman.github.io/a-taste-of-d3/)
- [D3 Sandwiches](http://aschneiderman.github.io/d3_sandwich/sandwiches/Abstract_Map_1/abstract_state_1_array.html), a pilot project to explore teaching d3 by interactively looking at the layers of a d3 "sandwich," in this case an abstract state map. 

Ultimately we decided to stop; D3.js is powerful but it's just too painful to teach to beginners who have no experience with coding
