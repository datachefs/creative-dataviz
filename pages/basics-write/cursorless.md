At the beginning, if you are having trouble grabbing the right words, take a closer look at the colors. For example, I was very frustrated until I realized that I kept thinking some dots were green when in fact they were blue. As soon as I realized I was doing that, the problem went away.

To toggle the dots, add a command: confetti off: user.vscode("cursorless.toggleDecorations")

pre every line block
