NOTES DUMP:

Unlike Dragon, out of the box Talon doesn't give you any commands.  But adding in the basics plus some cool, free tools is super easy.

(A lot more)


  - Clone kf files -- easiest is with GitHub Desktop
  - Put it in %AppData/Talon/user
  - Ask splondike: forking?  did i do this right?  merging in additions they've done?  https://talonvoice.slack.com/archives/C9LG0U0UQ/p1681809188197989
