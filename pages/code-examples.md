## Level 1: Simple Microwave Cooking (Popcorn, Hot Pockets)

Example:
```javascript
regionStatus = [  {name: "Northwest", value: 5}, {name: "Southwest", value: 3}, {name: East", value: 6}];
title = "How Are We Doing?";
flowerProgressChart(sunflower, data = regionStatus, title = title, maxValue = 7);
```

Example:
```javascript
volunteerActivity = simpleData.readCSV('volunteers-2023-10.csv');
volunteerAnimatedImages = [{status: "new", image: "kitten.jpg"}, {status: "dropped-out", image: "ruhroh.jpg"}, {status: "existing", image: "cat.jpg"}, {status: "new-leader", image: "lion.jpg"}];
animated3DTimeline(data = volunteerActivity, statuses = volunteerAnimatedImages,
	title = "The Last Four Months", background = "background.jpg", speed = 5, verticalSpaceBetweenImages = 10);
```

or:
```javascript
leadershipDevelopmentFunnel(data = volunteerActivity, statuses = volunteerAnimatedImages,
	title = "The Last Four Months", background = "background.jpg", speed = 5, verticalSpaceBetweenImages = 10);
```

What you need:
- A function that does what you want
- Some data -- probably relatively simple data
- Either some images you download from a free site & monkeying around, or a graphics designer who can create them. Possibly swap out on the regular -- e.g., October's weekly multistate volunteer team meetings, use Halloween items

## Level 2: Making a Sandwich

For more complex animations, you might:
- Call several functions/methods, each of which creates part of the animation as if snapping together Lego bricks -- e.g., a function that draws the flowers, a function that draws the sun, a series of phrases that are displayed as an animation runs through several months, etc.
use a loop to ___

Once someone gets comfortable with using these "make a simple sandwich" functions, they might open up one of the functions use it as a base to build their own.


- What makes for a great JavaScript library: must be semi-self-documenting, must feel like a recipe for an amateur cook
- Member volunteers helping out with this, either the libraries or with helping locals/chapters?
