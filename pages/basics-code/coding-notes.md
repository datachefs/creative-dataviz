# Coding Notes

hi ðŸ‘‹ trying Talon recently and it's really great. Is there a guide or can anyone give some tips on just writing code? not edit or manipulate code using cursorless, and not using snippets, like just writing from scratch. like how would you voice code this? Thank you
const [isPaused, setIsPaused] = useState(true)

timerId.current = setInterval(() => {
    setSeconds(prev => prev - 1)
}, 1000);

I'd say something like this:
word const space square
camel is paused
spamma camel set is paused
assign camel use state
args word true
slap second

camel timer id dot current
assign camel set interval
args args go right op arrow brace slap
camel set seconds args
brief previous arrow brief previous op minus one
slap spamma one thousand
