Mixed dictation mode?
- There's also mixed mode which acts like a dozen dragon/vocola by default.  There's a few settings you need to modify to get it into that mode but I find it works pretty well and use it all the time.  I could never get used to switching between modes...
- In the latest beta you only need to enable both modes at the same time, no other edits necessary (6/1/23)
