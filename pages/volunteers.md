Interested in helping out? For the pilot project, we are looking for 2 types of volunteers:
- Experienced graphic designers and artists
- Experienced developers -- ideally, JavaScript developers, but anyone who's skilled and can pick up a new language quickly

We are looking for 2 sets of volunteers:
- A small group of folks who will work with our pilot grassroots groups to innovatively develop the creative data visualizations
- A larger group of folks who will help to build out a bunch of examples, both to give grassroots groups in the next phase of the project a better sense of what's possible and also to explore what's easy and hard to do {reword; briefly explain: pairing up graphic designers with developers, a few developer things we want to figure out, such as making easy to add to / connect to Google sheets }

If you're interested, please fill out this form, and will get back in touch with you as soon as possible:

{ form }
