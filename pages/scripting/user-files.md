# user files

Is there any hope of talon picking up my custom files from Documents/Talon/user/* so that I don't have to go all the way into %appdata% to edit files? AppData is a normally hidden folder for apps-only use on Windows. I feel like it would be much more convenient for users to keep their custom stuff in Documents (although they would still have to hunt down knaus* files to modify them. Maybe one day talon could search both places for .talon and .py files?

yeah, create a shortcut in documents, so you can go to documents and click on the shortcut to open talon/user

so for the user story here, where "as a user, I don't know what's set up and I want to go find out and dig into it", I don't think the answer should be "look at these two folders in entirely different places"

On the off chance that you were not aware of this: I find saying "talon home" quite convenient to directly access that folder. 

I guess it would also be possible to create a command that directly loads the "appdata/roaming/talon/user" as a workspace in vscode.
